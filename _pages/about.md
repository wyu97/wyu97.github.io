I am a Senior Research Scientist in [Tencent AI](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/index.html), Seattle Lab. My primary research interest lies in natural language processing and machine learning. My current focus include several key areas: information retrieval, retrieval-augmented generation, large language model agent systems, and multi-modal learning. This specialization reflects my commitment to advancing artifical intelligence capabilities in understanding, reasoning, and interacting with the world.


I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) in 2023, advised by [Prof. Meng Jiang](http://www.meng-jiang.com/). My research during Ph.D was generously supported by [Bloomberg Ph.D Fellowship](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/values/tech-at-bloomberg/data-science/academic-engagement-programs/data-science-ph-d-fellowship/). I also enjoyed some amazing internship experiences at Microsoft Research, Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2), and Bloomberg along the way.
 <!-- During my Ph.D, I mainly worked on using knowledge (i.e., text retrieval, knowledge graph and etc) to enhance factuality and reasoning capibility of (large) language models. Prior to my Ph.D, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Sichuan University in 2019. -->
