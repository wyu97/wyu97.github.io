I am a fourth-year (2019-now) Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), and have the fortune to be advised by [Prof. Meng Jiang](http://www.meng-jiang.com/). I also work closely with [Dr. Chenguang Zhu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/chezhu/) from Microsoft Research. Before that, I received my bachelor degree of Computer Science and Technology at [Sichuan University](http://www.scu.edu.cn/) in 2019.

My primary research interest lies in natural language processing and machine learning. Specifically, I am working on using structured (e.g., knowledge graph) and unstructured (e.g., retrieved rext) knowledge to enhance language representation learning for open-domain question answering, commonsense reasoning and natural language generation tasks. I am also interested in using knowledge for better domain adaptation and few-shot learning. 

My research is generously supported by Bloomberg Ph.D. Fellowship, Notre Dame Grad School Select Fellowship, Microsoft Research and National Science Foundation.
